ETL WATERPOINTS
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) process of water point data in Ethiopia. The aim is to extract relevant information from water points across Ethiopia, including their historical climatic data, historical usage data, as well as administrative level data such as zone, woreda, and kebele to which they belong. Additionally, data related to the water points and their corresponding watersheds will be extracted and processed.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this ETL process is to gather comprehensive data on water points in Ethiopia, allowing researchers, policymakers, and humanitarian organizations to analyze and understand the state of water infrastructure and access across different regions. By integrating historical climatic data and usage patterns, this data can be utilized to identify trends, patterns, and potential challenges related to water availability and usage.

Data Sources
The data for this ETL process will be sourced from various reliable and publicly available datasets, including:

Water Points Data: Information on water points such as location, functionality, usage history, and other related attributes.

Climatic Data: Historical weather and climate data for the regions where the water points are located.

Administrative Data: Data on administrative divisions, including zone, woreda, and kebele, to which the water points belong.

Watershed Data: Information about the watersheds to which the water points are geographically associated.

ETL Process
The ETL process consists of the following key steps:

Extraction: Data will be extracted from the respective data sources mentioned above. APIs, web scraping, or direct downloads may be employed as required.

Transformation: Extracted data will be cleaned, processed, and transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis. This step involves data normalization, handling missing values, and aggregating relevant information.

Loading: The transformed data will be loaded into a database or data warehouse for efficient storage and retrieval. This step will ensure data integrity and consistency.

Requirements
To run this ETL process, the following requirements must be met:

Python 3.x or higher with necessary libraries for data manipulation and processing.
Access to the data sources or datasets required for extraction.
A database or data warehouse to store the processed data.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python libraries using the provided requirements.txt file.

Configure the necessary credentials or API keys, if applicable, to access the data sources.

Execute the ETL script to initiate the extraction, transformation, and loading process.
