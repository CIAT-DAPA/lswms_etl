It is located in the Southern part of the region (between 3°36 – 6°38’North latitude and 3°43’- 39°30’ East longitude). The zone is bordered by Kenya in the South, West Guji zone in the North, Somali region and Guji zone in the East and South Nations and Nationalities Peoples’ Region (SNNPR) in the West (Figure 1). the zone has thirteen rural pastoralist woreda namely, Arero, Dhas, Dillo, Dirre, Dubluk, Eelwoye, Gomole, Guchi, Miyo, Moyale, Taltale, Yaballo and Wachile. Yabelo is the capital town of Borana zone and located at about 570 km South of Addis Ababa. The zone covers almost 48,360 km2 out of which more than 75% is a lowland. ;The ephemeral drainage system of the Borana zone is located within the Genale-Dawa River basin. Groundwater levels are generally deep (<10m). To extract groundwater, the population of Borana are using traditional deep wells whose water retention potential varies with rainfall, the so-called ‘singing wells’. These deep wells of Borana have existed for over 20 years and today they still serve as a crucial resource of the Borana pastoralist production system.  Providing water under pastoral circumstances is difficult, primarily because of low population densities, nomadic culture and harsh environmental characteristics. Also, in providing new water sources (boreholes, ponds, and cisterns or birka) in these semi-arid areas, there is a risk of the livestock population rising above the (variable) carrying capacity of rangeland, and a potential for aggravating the impact of catastrophic events such as droughts. ;According to the 2007 census, the population of Borena zone was 962,489. In addition to the Census 2007, Finance and Economic Development Bureau of Borena zone has been updating the population basically every year though there is always difficulty in keeping accuracy of counting the people. The Bureau shows there were 1,886,900 population as of year 2022, which was increased to 196% as compared with the population of last census year 2007.;bega;belg;kiremt;meher;December to February;March to May;June to August;September to November;Traditional Wells or Singing Wells (Tullas);Spring Fed Ponds;Open Surface Ponds (Harros);Unprotected Perennial and Seasonal Springs;Scoop Wells on Sandy Rivers;Shallow Wells (Addadis)
